Bootstrap 2 Dark theme
==================

This theme is forked from `Bootstrap2 <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/bootstrap2>`_ theme.

It makes use of `Font-Awesome <http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/>`_ icons, supports tag_cloud, translation,
and try to keep other features from Pelican's default theme ``notmyidea``.

Also you can see its result from `my Github Page <http://frantic1048.github.io>`_. It will be updated using latest theme.

Feel free to use it.
